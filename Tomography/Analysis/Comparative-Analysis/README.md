# Tomography Analysis
Code for processing and comparative analysis of tomogram segmentation data

## Comparative Analysis

Analyses pore and particle surface data and plots comparative figures

Instructions: (1) input scans to be compared into "tomo_figs.m" and run (2) take maximum value of "plotmax" from output data struct, enter as "maxplotmax" in line 80 of "pore_totvol_dist_plot.m" (3) run "tomo_figs.m" again

Dependencies: output of pore_dist_looper.m ("pore_data_um_scan.mat" for each scan to be compared)
